# amplify-appsync-dynamodb
A sample backend application made from the Amplify CLI and AppSync as the Api for a social media app while using DynamoDb as the datasource.

This sample uses amplify directives `@key`, `@model` and `@connection` to form a relationship between all of the objects. 
The `.vtl` files show auto-generated resolvers from Amplify for the GraphQl schema defined which allow for mutations, queries and subscriptions.

## Sample queries and mutations
